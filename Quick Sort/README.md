## How does it work?

1. Select a pivot element from the array.
2. Put all the items smaller than the pivot value to the left and larger than the pivot value to the right.
3. Repeat the step-2 for both left and right side of the pivot (pick a pivot, put all item smaller than the pivot to the left and larger on the right).
